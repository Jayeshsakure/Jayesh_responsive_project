                <h1><span>REVERSE INLINE DOHC ENGINE</span></h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The TVS Apache RTR 310 is powered by a highly engineered 312.12cc, single-cylinder, 4-stroke, liquid-cooled engine that is reverse-inclined—designed to enhance mass centralization and handling. This DOHC engine is capable of producing up to 35.6 PS of power at 9,700 rpm and 28.7 Nm of torque at 6,650 rpm in its more aggressive riding modes (Sport, Track, and SuperMoto). For city riding or wet conditions, Urban and Rain modes are tuned to provide around 27.1 PS of power and 27.3 Nm of torque, making the engine adaptable to different environments and rider preferences.</p>

                <h1><span>Race Tuned Linear Stability Control Cruise-control</span></h1>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The TVS Apache RTR 310 comes equipped with segment-first cruise control, allowing riders to maintain a set speed without keeping the throttle engaged or clutching — a helpful feature for long-distance riding and reducing fatigue.The system activates once you're in 4th gear and above a minimum speed of around 40km/h, and you can easily adjust or resume the set speed using the toggle switch on the handlebar.For enhanced safety and stability, this feature is integrated with the bike's advanced electronics suite, including a 6-axis IMU, allowing for cornering cruise control—which automatically reduces speed while leaning into curves and restores it once upright.</p>

                <h1><span>6-Speed Gearbox With Quickshifter</span></h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The RTR 310 engine is paired with a 6-speed gearbox and comes equipped with a bi-directional quickshifter for seamless upshifts and downshifts without the clutch. A slipper clutch helps reduce wheel hop during aggressive downshifting, enhancing safety and smoothness. The electronic throttle control (ETC) ensures precise power delivery based on ride mode selection, while the forged aluminum piston improves engine responsiveness and durability.</p>

                <h1><span>RaceTuned Slipper Clutch</span></h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Race-Tuned (RT) slipper clutch as seen on the TVS Apache RR 310—a performance upgrade designed to deliver smoother gear shifts and enhanced stability, especially during aggressive downshifts.The system includes an Assist Function where clutch plates are locked tighter under acceleration, reducing the force needed to pull the clutch lever—making shifting smoother and less tiring.</p>

                <h1><span>Glide Through Technology</span></h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">GTT stands for Glide-Through Technology—a first-in-segment feature on the RTR 310. It allows the bike to set off smoothly at very low speeds without needing to twist the throttle. By simply releasing the clutch slowly, you can start rolling without stalling, making low-speed traffic a breeze.</p>

                 <h1><span>Liquid Cooled Oil Coolant Technology</span></h1>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">The cylinder head is designed with meticulous cooling in mind, promoting better heat dissipation. This ensures the engine runs cooler, performs more consistently, and can sustain higher revs without overheating.This system features a 23-row radiator that dramatically enhances cooling efficiency. The twin coolant and oil cooling setup ensures the engine maintains optimal operating temperatures even during prolonged high-speed or spirited rides, preserving performance and durability.</p>
